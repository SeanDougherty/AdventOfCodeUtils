# Advent of Code - The Developer's Elf

This is a python script built to be a little helper elf for developers solving the AdventOfCode Challenge. It is designed to wait until 12:00am EST and then pull your personal input for that days challenge. In addition, it will copy the contents of `/dummy` to a new folder along with your input and name that folder the integer value of the current day. (See https://github.com/seandough3rty/AdventOfCode2021 for an example of the created file structure)

To run Developer Elf:
1) Update the values within the `settings.ini` file
2) Customize the contents of the dummy directory as you see fit
3) Then simply run `python AoC.py`

If you are interested enough, please report bugs in the Issues section of this repo. I will try to check it periodically.
